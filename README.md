# Erasmus_University_of_Twente_2025_2026
Academic portfolio of my Erasmus Minor at the University of Twente (2025–2026), featuring projects and reports from the Experimental Mechanics track: Advanced Dynamics, Surface Mechanics, and Experimental Mechanics of Materials.

### 🧭 Repository Navigation

This repository contains all the projects and reports developed during my Erasmus Minor at the **University of Twente (2025–2026)**.  
It is organized into two main sections, corresponding to the two parts of the program:

- **📘 1A_Experimental_Mechanics/** – includes all work from the first semester (Q1), focused on experimental and analytical mechanics.  
  - `SM_SurfaceMechanics/` → Surface texturing, contact mechanics and laser micro-patterning.  
  - `EMM_ExperimentalMechanicsOfMaterials/` → Tensile testing, strain measurements and material characterization.  
  - `AD_AdvancedDynamics/` → Multi-degree-of-freedom models, modal analysis and vibration behaviour.  
- **✈️ 1B_Aircraft_Engineering/** *(upcoming)* – will include courses and projects from the second semester (Q2), related to aerodynamics, propulsion and flight mechanics.

Each subfolder contains:
- A short **README.md** summarizing the course content and objectives.  
- The full **report (PDF)** with the complete experimental or simulation results.
